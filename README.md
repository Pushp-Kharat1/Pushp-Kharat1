# 🦀 Pushp Kharat
### ML Systems Researcher & High-Performance Engineer

I build machine learning systems where performance is a first-class citizen. My work sits at the intersection of **Systems Programming (Rust/C++)** and **Applied ML Research**, with a specific focus on **Concept Drift Adaptation** and **Hardware-Aware Optimization**.

I prefer building quietly, measuring carefully, and optimizing relentlessly.

## 🔬 Research & Core Focus

I specialize in the **MLSys** domain—designing the computational engines that power modern AI. 

- [cite_start]**Algorithmic Research:** Specializing in **Concept Drift Adaptation** and **Self-Adaptive Gradient Boosting** for non-stationary data streams[cite: 1, 5, 10].
- [cite_start]**Low-Level Systems:** Implementing high-performance kernels using **SIMD** (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), multi-threading via **Rayon**, and memory-safe systems in **Rust**[cite: 1, 13, 54].
- [cite_start]**Optimization:** Expertise in **Numerical Optimization** ($\text{Newton-Raphson}$), **Information Theory** ($\text{Shannon Entropy}$), and sub-millisecond similarity search[cite: 1, 11, 20, 53].
- [cite_start]**Infrastructure:** Architecting asynchronous, high-throughput backends using **Axum** and **Tokio**[cite: 1, 19, 55].

## 🚀 Featured Research: [PKBoost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/PKBoost)
[cite_start]**Self-Adaptive Gradient Boosting Library in Rust** *Mentored by Ash Vardanian (Founder, Unum Cloud)*[cite: 1, 16].

[cite_start]PKBoost is a production-ready GBDT framework built to handle "drifting" data where standard models fail[cite: 1, 7, 10].

- [cite_start]**Technical Edge:** Shannon entropy-guided splitting with second-order Newton optimization[cite: 1, 11].
- [cite_start]**Performance:** SIMD-accelerated kernels and metamorphic drift adaptation[cite: 1, 12, 13].
- [cite_start]**Empirical Results:** Maintained accuracy with only $2.8\%$ $PR-AUC$ degradation under severe drift, compared to $12-18\%$ for $XGBoost$ and $LightGBM$[cite: 1, 14].
- [cite_start]**Impact:** $2,400+$ PyPI downloads and permanently archived (DOI: $10.5281/zenodo.17568991$)[cite: 1, 4, 8, 15].

## 🥊 The Discipline of Engineering

[cite_start]Outside of code, I am an **Amateur MMA District Gold Medalist** with a $5-1$ record[cite: 1, 62].

Engineering and combat sports share the same DNA:
- **Pressure Testing:** A system's reliability is only proven when it is stressed to its limit.
- [cite_start]**Fundamental Mastery:** I prioritize deep knowledge of **Data Structures**, **Operating Systems**, and **Mathematics** over high-level framework hype[cite: 1, 60].
- **Relentless Improvement:** Building elite systems requires the same daily discipline as a professional training camp.
