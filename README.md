# 🦀 Pushp Kharat
### ML Systems Engineer | Rust & C++ Performance Specialist

I build machine learning systems where performance isn't an afterthought—it's the foundation. My focus is at the intersection of **hardware-aware optimization** and **robust ML infrastructure**. I prefer building quietly, measuring carefully, and improving relentlessly.

## 🛠 Technical Philosophy

I specialize in moving beyond "abstraction-heavy magic" to build models and pipelines that are efficient, interpretable, and reliable under real-world constraints.

- **Systems-Oriented ML:** Building high-performance components in **Rust** and **C++** (SIMD, multithreading, and memory-conscious design).
- **Production-Grade Models:** Expertise in **GBDTs**, statistical models, and LLM infrastructure—focusing on what survives production, not just benchmarks.
- **Hardware Awareness:** Optimizing for CPU efficiency, cache locality, and parallelism to reduce training costs and inference latency.
- **Interoperability:** Architecting Python bindings via **PyO3** to bring "close-to-the-metal" speed to the data science ecosystem.

## 🚀 Flagship Project: [PKBoost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/PKBoost)
**A High-Performance Gradient Boosting Framework written in Rust.**

PKBoost embodies my engineering philosophy: *Classical ML + Modern Systems Engineering beats fragile complexity.*

* **Speed:** SIMD-accelerated computation and multi-threaded training.
* **Efficiency:** Designed for large datasets with a low memory footprint.
* **Practicality:** Seamless Python integration for real-world adoption.

## 🥊 The Engineering of Discipline

Outside of software, I am an **Amateur MMA fighter with a 5–1 record**. 

Combat sports have shaped my approach to engineering:
* **Execution > Theory:** A system only works if it survives the "pressure test" of production.
* **Mastery of Fundamentals:** I prioritize understanding memory management and algorithms over chasing ephemeral trends.
* **Long-term Consistency:** Building reliable systems requires the same daily discipline as a training camp.
